!!!Make sure you are in directory lab1-xin-junyang/lab1 before running any of the following commands!!!

1) Compile all the java files by running (under directory lab1):

   bash compileLab1.sh

2) Create a data file which contains the input data, let say the filename is 'input':

   vim input

   And paste the input data into the file. You can then replace the content of this file with new input data.

3) Run the program against the 'input' file:

   bash runLab1.sh input

   The result will be printed out to stdout.
