1) Change directory to lab3-xin-junyang/lab3 (suppose you are already under
lab3-xin-junyang/):

   cd lab3

>>>>> Please make sure you are in directory lab3-xin-junyang/lab3 before running any of the following commands! <<<<<

2) Compile all the java files by running:

   bash compileLab3.sh

3) Create a text file which contains the input data, let say the filename is 'input.txt':

   vim input.txt

   And paste the input data into the file. You can then replace the content of this file with new input data.

5) Run the program against the 'input.txt' file:

   bash runLab3.sh input.txt

   The result will be printed out to stdout.
